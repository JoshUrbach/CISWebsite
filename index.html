				<p>Professor Knorr was the receipient of the 2022 School of Arts and Sciences Award for Excellence in Adjunct Teaching! 
				He has been with Gwynedd Mercy University's Computer Information Science team for 10 years, and expressed how meaningful it was to be honored by his students when given the award. He is the first adjunct professor in the CIS department to receive this award, and was up against 77 other eligible instructors. The award is based on a survey that goes to all undergraduate students, and this year there was a very high response rate. <br><br> Congratulations, Professor Knorr!</p>
